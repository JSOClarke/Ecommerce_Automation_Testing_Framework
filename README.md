# Personal Automation Framework

Welcome to my personal testing project! This repo demonstrates how I apply software testing best practices using an example eCommerce website.

## 🔍 Purpose

I'm using this repo to test a demo bookstore/eCommerce site using a modern test stack:

-  **Playwright for automated UI testing**
-  **API testing** (GET, POST, error handling, etc.)
-  **Docker-based environment setup**
-  **Test planning**, edge case design, and issue reporting practices - (testcase xml included)

## Technologies used

| Area               | Stack                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Frontend testing   | Playwright + TypeScript   |
| Backend/API testing| REST calls via Playwright |
| Environment        | Docker + PHP + Laravel    |
| Project management | Manual planning + TODOs   |
