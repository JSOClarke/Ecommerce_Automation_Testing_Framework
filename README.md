# Ecommerce Automation Testing Framework

Welcome to my personal testing project! This repo demonstrates how I apply software testing best practices using an eCommerce website.

## Purpose

I'm using this repo to test a demo eCommerce site using a modern test stack:

-  **Playwright for automated UI testing**
-  **Test planning**, edge case design, and issue reporting practices - (testcase_writeup.md included)

## Technologies used

| Area               | Stack                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Frontend testing   | Playwright + TypeScript   |
| Project management | Manual planning + TODOs   |
